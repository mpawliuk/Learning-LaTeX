    "You're about to learn how to use LaTeX (pronounced), a computer language used by mathematicians and physicists to nicely format mathematical expressions. Every math student will eventually need to know how to write in LaTeX, since all math journals are written using LaTeX. It is also used in every online platform that supports math writting, such as Github, Wordpress blogs, and Mathoverflow.\n",
